## Sum All Numbers in a Range

1. We'll pass you an array of two numbers. 
2. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. 
3. It's not necessary that you'll get the lowest number at first.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [4, 1]
<b>Output:</b> 10
</pre>


**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [5, 10]
