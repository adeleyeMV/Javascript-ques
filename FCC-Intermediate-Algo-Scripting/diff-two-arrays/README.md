## Diff Two Arrays

1. Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. 
3. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.
4. **Note:** You can return the array with its elements in any order.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1, "calf", 3, "piglet"], [1, "calf", 3, 4]
<b>Output:</b> ["piglet", 4]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
<b>Output:</b> [4]
</pre>
